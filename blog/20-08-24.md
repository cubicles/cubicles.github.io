## Consider (_insert the current thing_)

Consider a programming language as a tool and just a tool. Inside its deep
intricacies lies foundational knowledge to get to known the tool itself. Just
as a high-dexterity suction object manipulation robot, a programming language
carries a high degree of internal complexity but can be used quite easily to
perform a variety of straigh-forward oriented tasks: open this file, write 
this object, delete this thing. Truly a remarkable feat.

Consider the invisible line that divides this physical world and the mystical
space of abstraction and creativity. I find fascinating how waves travel
across the air fluid transmitting something more than energy. How magical is
that we can fantasize about abstractions landing them to physical devices
while still remaining the substance of the ideas in our heads. We truly are
the ultimate transductors for getting food out of thin air through a computer

Consider the incredible yet unsolved problem of being able to read almost
every scent known to one own memory and just everywhere out there in the world
but eventually getting stomped in the face with the ability to write none.
Cats do feel and communicate different than humans.

Consider the complex nature of our resilience. I truly feel connected to my
own survival instincts when sitting silent and listening to my own heart
